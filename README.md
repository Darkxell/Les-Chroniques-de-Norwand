# Les-Chroniques-de-Norwand

An androidXcomputer action rpg, made by a team of 7 students in a computer sciences university.
We are first and second year students and are making this game as our final exam.
Our goal with this is to make a cross platform action rpg, fully free to play.

There's nothing to say really, it's basically it... Furthermore information will be on the game's website.
